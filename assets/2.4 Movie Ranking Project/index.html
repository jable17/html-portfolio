<h1>The Best Movies According to Jade</h1>
<h2>Top Three This Year</h2>
<hr/>
    <h3>Pride & Prejudice (2005)</h3>
        <p>This is a masterpiece of a movie that I watch on repeat. The music, actors, visuals, dialogue, and plot are just spectacular. The hand flexing scene in particular is is scream inducing.</p>
    <h3>The Queen's Gambit (2020)</h3>
        <p>This is technically a show, but it's amazing. The character development is spectacular, as well as the sense of suspense in every game.</p>
    <h3>Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy (2003-2007)</h3>
        <p>Another one of my all time favorites. The jokes and fight scenes are great, and the romance plot is the cutest</p>
